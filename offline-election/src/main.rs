//! ### Builders
//!
//! Several tools have already built on top of this repo, such:
//!
//! - https://polkadot.pro/phragmen.php
//! - https://polkadot.staking4all.org/
//!
//! Note that the npos results generate by this repo or any of the above tools will not be exactly
//! equal to that of polkadot and kusama. This is highly dependent on the arguments passed to the
//! `staking` sub-command. The NPoS solution of both polkadot and kusama is being computed in a
//! non-deterministic way.
//!
//! As of this writing, the validator election of Polkadot/Kusama is as such: seq-phragmen -> random
//! iterations of balancing -> reduce. This translates to:
//!
//! ```
//! cargo run -- staking -i 10 -r
//! ```
//!
//! And **if executed at the correct time** (i.e. while the election window is open), this should
//! *accurately predict the next validator set*, but the nominator stake distribution will be
//! different, because the random number of iterations is not known.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Simply run `--help`.
//!
//! ```
//! Offline elections app.
//!
//! Provides utilities and debug tools around the election pallets of a substrate chain offline.
//!
//! Can be used to predict next elections, diagnose previous ones, and perform checks on validators and nominators.
//!
//! USAGE:
//!     offline-election [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>
//!
//! FLAGS:
//!     -h, --help
//!             Prints help information
//!
//!     -V, --version
//!             Prints version information
//!
//!     -v
//!             Print more output
//!
//!
//! OPTIONS:
//!         --at <at>
//!             The block number at which the scrap should happen. Use only the hex value, no need for a `0x` prefix
//!
//!     -n, --network <network>
//!             Network address format. Can be kusama|polkadot|substrate.
//!
//!             This will also change the token display name. [default: polkadot]
//!         --uri <uri>
//!             The node to connect to [default: ws://localhost:9944]
//!
//!
//! SUBCOMMANDS:
//!     command-center         Display the command center of the staking panel
//!     council                Run the council election
//!     current                Display the current validators
//!     dangling-nominators    Show the nominators who are dangling:
//!     help                   Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
//!     next                   Display the next queued validators
//!     nominator-check        The general checkup of a nominator
//!     staking                Run the staking election
//!     validator-check        The general checkup of a validators
//! ```
//!
//! ## Overriding data
//!
//! You can override voters and candidates in both staking and council election py passing a `-m` or
//! `--manual-override` flag. This must point to a json file that contains the following keys:
//! 1. `voters`: the new voters to be added.
//! 2. `candidates`: the new candidates to be added.
//! 3. `voters_remove`: voters to be removed.
//! 4. `candidates_remove`: candidates to be removed.
//!
//! Note that first the incomings are added, and then any voter/candidate in the outgoing list is
//! stripped out.
//!
//! Find an example [here](./override_example.json).
//!
//! ## Example usage
//!
//! - Run the council election with 25 members.
//!
//! ```
//! RUST_LOG=offline-phragmen=trace cargo run -- council --count 25
//! ```
//!
//! - Run the staking election with no equalization at a particular block number
//!
//! ```
//! cargo run --at 8b7d6e14221b4fefc4b007660c80af6d4a9ac740c50b6e918f61d521553cd17e staking
//! ```
//!
//! - Run the election with only 50 slots, and print all the nominator distributions
//!
//! ```
//! cargo run -- -vv staking --count 50
//! ```
//!
//! - Run the above again now with `reduce()` and see how most nominator edges are... reduced.
//!
//! ```
//! cargo run -- -vv staking --count 50 --reduce
//! ```
//!
//! - Run the above again now against a remote node.
//!
//! ```
//! cargo run -- --uri wss://kusama-rpc.polkadot.io/ -vv staking --count 50 --reduce
//! ```
//!
//! ## Connecting to a node
//!
//! > Both Polkadot and Kusama are growing fast and scraping the data is becoming harder and harder.
//! I > really recommend you to try this script against a local node, or be prepared to wait for a
//! while.
//!
//! By default it will attempt to connect to a locally running node running at
//! `ws://127.0.0.1:9944`.
//!
//! Connect to a different node using the `--uri` argument e.g. `--uri
//! wss://kusama-rpc.polkadot.io/`.
//!
//! - **`ws://`** prefix: plain (unencrypted) websockets connection.
//! - **`wss://`** prefix: TLS (encrypted) websockets connection.
//!
//! ## Logging
//!
//! Scripts output additional information as logs. You need to enable them by setting `RUST_LOG`
//! environment variable.
//!
//! Also, you can always use `-v`, `-vv`, ... to get more output out of each script.
